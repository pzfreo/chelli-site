Paul Fremantle is the craftsman behind Chelli Strings.

Before studying to make stringed instruments, Paul was a successful technical lead in the enterprise software industry. 
Paul is currently studying historic instrument making at [West Dean College](https://www.westdean.ac.uk).

The ethos of Paul's making is that musical instruments become living things at the hands of musicians. This transformation is the heart of the relationship between musician and instrument.
The start of this journey begins when an instrument is made. Instruments that are handmade and crafted with love and attention have an aura that makes each handcrafted instrument unique. 
It is Paul's aim to build instruments that can last generations: made with care, attention and with only highest quality wood - designed to be highly playable.

If you want to commission an instrument from Chelli, start by thinking what it is that excites you about the instrument. What is your vision for a unique instrument? 
How will it play? How will it feel? How will it sound? How will it look? These are our starting points on every journey to create something new.
