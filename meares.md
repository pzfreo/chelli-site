The Meares 1660 is one of the most intact 17th century viols in existence, with everything apart from the strings, the bridge and two of the pegs in full original condition. The viol you see was created after two visits to examine the original and using detailed drawings. Rather than the original carved head, this viol has a pierced scroll after a Barack Norman viol in Berlin. 

The viol has flamed maple back and sides with double purfling and a bent front made from alpine spruce. The fingerboard and tailpiece are maple with ebony veneer. The purfling is all handmade from dyed pear and poplar. The pegs are turned from boxwood and it is strung in high twist lambs gut strings, with a wound low D string. The scale length is 707mm.
