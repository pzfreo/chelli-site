This guitar is loosely based  on a Terz guitar 1829 from Johann Georg Stauffer. Terz guitars are tuned a third higher than standard guitars and have a correspondingly shorter scale length (570mm). There are some modern touches, such as the choice of woods, and planetary  geared tuning pegs.

This guitar has sapele sides and neck. The back is created from alternate strips of sapele and walnut with maple inserts. The front is made of Western Red Cedar. The headstock veneer is bookmatched ebony and quilted sapele. There is a matching piece of quilted sapele for the wedge. The bindings are ebony with handmade purfling insert.
The neck has a classic V joint for the neck and the neck angle is adjustable allowing the action to be set very easily. 

The sound of this instrument is warm and mellow. The small size of this guitar makes it a joy to play.
