<p>
Commissioning an instrument is a simple process. We will start with a discussion about the design of the instrument.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Is it a historical recreation or a new design?</li>
<li> What is the sound you are looking for?</li>
<li> What aesthetic inspires you?</li>
<li> Which instruments have you been drawn to?</li>
<li> Do you have specific playability requirements - string length, action, spacing, etc?</li>
<li> What is your budget?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once we have these ideas clarified you will receive a personalised quotation and specification. At this point if you go ahead, we will agree a timeframe.
In order to secure the making, please provide a 10% deposit. If it is a very unusual instrument then a larger deposit will be required.
</p>
<p/>
You will get regular updates on the progress. Once the instrument is ready for varnishing a further deposit is paid and the final amount is payable on delivery.

<p/>
Commissioning a bespoke instrument that is built to your personal requirements offers the opportunity to have an instrument that fits you perfectly.
