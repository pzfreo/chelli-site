Commissioning an instrument is very simple. We will start with a discussion about the design of the instrument.
* Is it a historical recreation or a new design?
* What is the sound you are looking for?
* What aesthetic inspires you?
* Which instruments have you been drawn to?
* Do you have specific playability requirements - string length, action, spacing, etc?
* What is your budget?

Once we have these ideas clarified you will receive a personalised quotation and specification. At this point if you go ahead, we will agree a timeframe.
In order to secure the making, please provide a 10% deposit. If it is a very unusual instrument then a larger deposit will be required.

You will get regular updates on the progress. Once the instrument is ready for varnishing a further deposit is paid and the final amount is payable on delivery.

Commissioning a bespoke instrument that is built to your personal requirements offers the opportunity to have an instrument that fits you perfectly.
