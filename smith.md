This viol is based on the Henry Smith viol from 1637. This was my first bass viol.

{% include album2.html albumname="smith" %}

The viol has flamed maple back and sides with a single black-white-black purfling and a bent front made from alpine spruce. The fingerboard and tailpiece are yew, and the heartwood is used to create a modern take on an age old instrument. The scale length is 690mm.
