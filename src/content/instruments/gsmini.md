GS Mini style guitar in Indian Rosewood.

This guitar is a joy to hold and play. With a short scale length (597mm) and small body, this guitar sounds bigger than it is. The top is Sitka spruce, with a carefully tuned bracing pattern. The back and sides are Indian Rosewood with inlays of quilted sapele. The rosette is also quilted sapele. The neck is walnut laminated with maple.
