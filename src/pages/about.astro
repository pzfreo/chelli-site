          The ethos of my making is that musical instruments become living things at the hands of musicians. This transformation is the heart of the relationship between musician and instrument.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The start of this journey begins when an instrument is made. Instruments that are bespoke and crafted with love and attention have an aura that makes each handcrafted instrument unique.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          It is my vision to build instruments that can last generations: made with care and attention; using only wonderful wood; designed to play fluidly and sound rich and timbral.
