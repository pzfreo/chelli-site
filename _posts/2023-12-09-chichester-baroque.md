#### Visit to Chichester Baroque Orchestra

Chichester University has a vibrant Baroque Orchestra, led by the marvellous [Julia Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Bishop). This week a group of West Dean students went to visit the group, taking along instruments and bows that we had made for them to try out.

We had two bass viols, a treble viol, a baroque violin and a number of baroque bows for them to try. It was enlightening to see how well they managed and we plan further collaboration next year.

A number of the group tried out the bass viols and were very interested in the differences between viols and the violin family. There was also deep interest in the baroque bows which were made last year by the second years at West Dean.
