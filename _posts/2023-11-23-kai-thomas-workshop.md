#### Spending time with Kai-Thomas Roth

Last week I spent some time in the workshop of [Kai-Thomas Roth](https://kai-thomas-roth-cellos.co.uk/) who kindly let me watch his work making cellos.

Kai-Thomas is a highly experienced cello maker, well-known for his research and making of five string cellos and baroque cellos.

I spent a few days in his workshop working on a practice scroll in the style of Maggini - much more freely carved than a Strad scroll with some clear asymmetry and dynamic form.

Many thanks to Kai for giving me the opportunity to pick his brains and get an idea of his working methods and approach. Much appreciated!
