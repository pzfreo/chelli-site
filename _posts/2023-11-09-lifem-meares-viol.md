#### Meares Viol debuts at London Early Music show

The bass viol is complete and is getting its debut at the [London International Festival of Early Music](https://lifem.org/), more commonly known as LIFEM.

The festival of early music was a wonderful launchpad for the new Meares viol. Below you can see it on the West Dean stand (its the viol up on the table). More pictures are available in the [Gallery](/gallery/meares). It was joyful to hear a number of professional musicians playing the viol and get some good feedback on the setup, sound and playability.
