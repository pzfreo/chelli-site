Chelli Strings crafts handmade bass viols and cellos, both modern and baroque. Paul Fremantle is the craftsman behind Chelli Strings.
The ethos of our making is that musical instruments become living things at the hands of musicians. This transformation is the heart of the relationship between musician and instrument.

For more information, please read [about us](/about) and take a look at previous instruments in the [gallery](/gallery).

We also regularly update the [blog](/blog).
