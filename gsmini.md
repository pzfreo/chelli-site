This guitar is a joy to hold and play. With a short scale length (597mm) and small body, this guitar sounds bigger than it is. The top is Sitka spruce, with a carefully tuned bracing pattern. The back and sides are Indian Rosewood with inlays of quilted sapele. The rosette is also quilted sapele. The neck is walnut laminated with maple. 

For sale: Â£1500
